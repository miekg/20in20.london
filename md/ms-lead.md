Multiple sclerosis, often abbreviated to MS, is a neurological condition that affects the nerves in
the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). **Sclerosis** means scarring or hardening of
tiny patches of tissue and the condition is known as **Multiple Sclerosis** because this happens at more than 
one place in the brain
and/or spinal cord. The damage to nerves seems to be due to the immune system mistakenly attacking
the nerve coating which is made of a fatty protein called *myelin*.
