## What does the MS Trust do?

At the [MS Trust](https://www.mstrust.org.uk/),
 we want to help people to help themselves by taking more control over their MS.
 Our team produces practical, evidence-based information so individuals can:

* - Make choices that are right for them.
* - Decide how best to deal with their own health.
* - Be better-informed in discussions with health professionals.

We are the only charity offering education to all MS Nurses, and we are
also starting to fund MS Nurses.

## £20,000 will allow us to:

* - Cover the costs of our enquiry line for one-year, to answers questions about
  MS for people living within the London Boroughs.
* - Train twelve MS Nurses who are new in post and attend our development module.
* - Produce and send [our publications](https://support.mstrust.org.uk/shop)
  to people affected with MS living within the London Boroughs for one quarter.
* - Publish four issues of Open Door, our quarterly newsletter.
