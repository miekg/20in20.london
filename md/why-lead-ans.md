It is nearly ten years ago since I woke up one morning to find my sight
was a bit blurry. Okay, Iâ€™d had a few glasses of wine the night before but
this was weird. It got worse over the next few days. I went to the GP and
had some tests. By then I wasn't able to see the big letters on the chart
with my left eye.
